During my time at Yapily I implemented a Python script that allows agile teams to track, monitor and plan sprints. This script computes average and accumulated delivery speeds across sprints and developers. In order to do the above, the script connects to the Jira API to fetch sprint data, to the Google Calendar API in order to fetch team memberâ€™s OOO days and calculate team availability, and to the Google Sheets API to plot the resulting data.
